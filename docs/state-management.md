## state-management package

A library for managing local and global state.

## Remarks

The implementation is similar to the redux design pattern.

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [ActionDispatcher](./state-management.actiondispatcher.md) | Responsible for providing an action observer of dispatched actions. Primarily used by [EffectsSubscriber](./state-management.effectssubscriber.md) to handle effects. |
|  [ComponentEffectsSubscriber](./state-management.componenteffectssubscriber.md) | Responsible for injecting effects (see [Effect](./state-management.effect.md)<!-- -->) within its provider scope Effects are handled be subscribing and dispatching the returning actions to the store. |
|  [ComponentStore](./state-management.componentstore.md) | Responsible for providing read and write access to a local state within its provider scope. |
|  [EffectsSubscriber](./state-management.effectssubscriber.md) | Responsible for injecting effects (see [Effect](./state-management.effect.md)<!-- -->) for a given component Effects are handled be subscribing and dispatching the returning actions to the store. |
|  [StateManagementModule](./state-management.statemanagementmodule.md) | Responsible for configuring providers Required in root to setup core providers with the forRoot function. that configures state providers like [Reducer](./state-management.reducer.md) or [Effect](./state-management.effect.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [Store](./state-management.store.md) | Responsible for providing read and write access to global state. |

## Interfaces

|  [DispatchedAction](./state-management.dispatchedaction.md) | Represents an action that has been dispatched by a [Store](./state-management.store.md) |
|  [Effect](./state-management.effect.md) | Represents a class for handling side effects on dispatched action(s). Provided with token [STORE\_EFFECTS](./state-management.store_effects.md) |
|  [Reducer](./state-management.reducer.md) | Represents an object used to modify state on a specified action. Provided with token [STORE\_REDUCERS](./state-management.store_reducers.md) |
|  [StateAction](./state-management.stateaction.md) |  |
|  [StateChanges](./state-management.statechanges.md) | Represents a state change containing changed state and responsible action |
|  [StateManagementProviders](./state-management.statemanagementproviders.md) |  |
|  [StoreSettings](./state-management.storesettings.md) | Represents an object with store configurations. Provided with token [STORE\_SETTINGS](./state-management.store_settings.md) |

|  [listenTo](./state-management.listento.md) | An rxjs operator used to filter the types of actions provided from an action observer. |
|  [select](./state-management.select.md) | An rxjs operator used to select a specified slice from state and only emit when its value changes. |
|  [selectProp](./state-management.selectprop.md) | An rxjs operator used to select a specified property from state and only emit when its value changes. |
|  [STORE\_ACTION\_INTERCEPTORS](./state-management.store_action_interceptors.md) |  |
